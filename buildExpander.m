% the coo implementation of expander matrix

% Notes by Jared Tanner:
% A somewhat better implementation would be to use sparse matrix format such as coo,
% and also not to regenerate the random permutation for each column.  It is preferable to
% generate the matrix as in the attached, which generates a random permutation of m, uses the
% first d of these as the row index for the first column, uses the next d of them as the row index
% for the second column, etc.. until needing to generate a new random permutation of m for more
% rows.  This ensures that the first floor(m/d) columns are disjoint which isnâ€™t true for the random
% construction
